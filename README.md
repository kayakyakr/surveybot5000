## Thoughts

Incomplete because job opportunity dried up.

I tried to keep the implementation simple but flexible, sticking with old-fashioned http forms
and only using jquery to handle a few more specialized commands. Stayed away from a framework as it was
unnecessary.

Did include bootstrap as the quickest way for me to get a bit of style in there.
